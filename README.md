This repository serves as an archive of the data I have personally dumped and submitted to video game preservation groups. This provides both an accurate reference for myself and a permanent place to store the data should there ever be any need to resubmit it.

More info:
- [The Redump project](http://wiki.redump.org/index.php?title=Redump.org) (Disc preservation)
- [The No-Intro project](https://no-intro.org/) (Cartridge and others preservation)

Note that like these organizations, this repository does ***NOT*** collect any game files. I neither support nor condone software piracy or illegal distribution of copyrighted material. Scans and photos of copyrighted content stored here are for documentation and preservation purposes only.
